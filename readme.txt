Manage WooCommerce shipping with custom states and weight-based methods filtered by product categories. Fast and flexible.

== Description ==

**Custom Shipping Manager for WooCommerce** allows you to define and manage custom state (or district) options and create flexible shipping methods (weight-based with product category filters) for any country in WooCommerce checkout forms.

This is especially useful if your business operates in regions that are not covered by WooCommerce's default state lists — such as custom districts in Bangladesh, provinces in African countries, or extra regions within the United States — and also requires advanced shipping methods based on weight and product categories.

With a simple admin UI and seamless WooCommerce integration, your customers can now choose from precise and relevant shipping regions and shipping methods tailored to your business.

✅ Ideal for:
- Local delivery businesses
- Regional shipping rate setup
- Weight-based shipping (with product category filter)
- WooCommerce store owners in non-standard countries
